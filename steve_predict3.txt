It will also pay off an IRS debt of $1800. I have medical bills including an Anesthesia bill that is nearly $3000. This loan will pay that off too. If we keep paying minimum payments, our loans will take FOREVER to pay off. By consolidating, the loans will be paid off immediately and the Debt Consolidation Loan from Lending Club will be paid off in 3 years of less. Our goal is to pay this loan off in less than 2 years. The Debt Consolidation payment is LESS than our current minimum monthly payments. We will cancel nearly all of our credit cards once paid off with this loan. I will leave 1 card open since I need to use it for traveling expenses with my job. I get reimburesed for all travel and job-related expenses. I have worked in the same industry for over 20 years and I have a very stable job. I sell back up power solutions to data centers, telecom providers, and utility customers. <br/>Thank you Lending Club investors!<br/>","debt_consolidation","Debt Consolidation Loan","HUSTON","TX","0","","","","","3.06","2","0","1999-01-19 02:06","660","664","5","5","","","","","","","6","","0","","9337.0","61.8%","","38","f","4278.59","4273.20","22092.839999999997","20809.23","15721.42","6371.42","0.0","2013-06-24","781.72","2013-08-02","2013-06-25","594","590","","","","","0","","0","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
